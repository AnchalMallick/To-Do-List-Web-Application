# To-Do-List-Web-Application
DONE:
I have built a to-do list web application. It allows user to plan their day by adding chores to be done and striking them off after finishing them. 
The frontend(client side) is built using HTML and CSS. EJS is used for creating HTML templates and layouts. NodeJS and ExpressJS is used for backend(server side). Database integration using MongoDB is implemented for data persistence. Custom lists can be created by adding the custom list name at the end of url. This feature is implemented using express route parameters.
