# To-Do-List-Web-Application
DONE:
I have built a to-do list web application. It allows user to plan their day by adding chores to be done and striking them off after finishing them. 
The frontend(client side) is built using HTML and CSS. EJS is used for creating HTML templates and layouts. NodeJS and ExpressJS is used for backend(server side).

TO DO:
(1) Integration with database to enable saving the content even on restarting the server, updating and deleting functionality.
(2) Deployment of the web app on Heroku.
